# Understanding-Artificial-Intelligence
A structured portfolio of AI learning projects. The goal is to demonstrate my understanding of core AI concepts, experiment with cutting-edge tools like LLMs and agents, and build a strong foundation through hands-on notebooks and documentation.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main areas of AI focus:

### ðŸ¤– [LLMs](./Sub-Lessons/)
Large Language Models - Implementations, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and practical applications of various LLM architectures.

### ðŸ§  [Agents](./Agents/)
AI Agents - Development of autonomous agents, multi-agent systems, and agent-based problem solving solutions.

### ðŸš€ [Hosting-AI](./Hosting-AI/)
Hosting AI - Model deployment, cloud integrations, MLOps, and production-ready AI hosting solutions.

## Getting Started

Each sub-repository contains its own README with specific details about the projects and resources available. Navigate to any of the directories above to explore specific areas of AI development.

## Goals

- Demonstrate practical understanding of core AI concepts
